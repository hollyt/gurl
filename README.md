# :sparkles: gurl :sparkles:
### gurl is a url shortener written in go.

Since I plan on using this for my personal use only, the
shortened => original url map is stored in an sqlite database.

You probably shouldn't use this as a model for your own url
shortening service (since this is just a fun experiment and
I can't guarantee that things won't break/go horribly wrong.),
but if you do, you'll want to change localhost:8080 to your own domain.
